Learning to upload files.

So, I had a hard time trying to figure out why my geojson file wouldn't display as a map. After hours of troubleshooting and problem solving, I finally figured out that the shapefile I was using was too large. So once I changed to a smaller file, everyth-ing worked fine. So please use the hist.geojson file.
