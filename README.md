Learning to upload files.

My GitHub map will be diferent from my PDF, becuase the shapefile I used in TileMill is too large for GitHub to display as a map, or too large to convert from a shapefile to GeoJSON.

So, I had a hard time trying to figure out why my geojson file wouldn't display as a map. After hours of troubleshooting and problem solving, I finally figured out that the shapefile I was using was too large. So once I changed to a smaller file, everything worked fine. So please use the hist.geojson file.
